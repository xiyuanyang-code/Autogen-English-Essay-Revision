**The More Transparent, the Better**

When students face the challenge of selecting courses for the upcoming semester, they often turn to course selection communities for guidance. These platforms provide ratings and comments on teachers and classes, offering valuable insights. Such rating websites and forums have become increasingly common on campuses. From my perspective, transparent ratings of courses and instructors are essential in helping students make informed decisions.  

Firstly, a transparent rating system allows students to gain an overview of a teacher’s course content, teaching style, and grading criteria before enrolling. This information can significantly enhance students’ academic performance. For instance, students interested in a course’s content but concerned about grading can weigh their options after consulting these platforms, thereby avoiding poor decisions. In essence, access to more information leads to more rational choices, rather than blindly selecting courses based solely on their titles.  

Moreover, from the teachers’ perspective, a transparent rating system serves as a mechanism for improving teaching quality. A free and inclusive environment encourages students to express their opinions about courses openly. By receiving constructive feedback, teachers can adjust course arrangements to better meet students’ needs. Just as chefs refine dishes based on customer feedback, educators can continuously improve their courses to earn greater favor from students.  

Critics may argue that anonymous and open rating systems can sometimes lack authenticity and objectivity, potentially infringing on teachers’ privacy. While it is true that some comments may fail to provide objective course information, public feedback fosters an open atmosphere. Measures can be implemented to address these concerns, ensuring that course-related information remains separate from personal privacy issues.  

In conclusion, allowing public comments on courses greatly benefits students’ course selection process and enhances the quality of instruction provided by teachers.
