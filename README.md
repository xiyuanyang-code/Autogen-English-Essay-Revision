# English Essay Revision based on Camel-AI Agentic Framework

## Introduction

This is an English blog editing system that uses Camel-AI[^1] as an agent automation framework. This feature enables automated article enhancement, including organizing logic, improving word choice, and correcting grammar.

This is my first attempt at building a complex (maybe?) multi-agent system! I hope you can have fun!

## File Structure

All the files are demonstrated:

- `README.md`

- `data`

  - `Final.txt`: The final text (To be done)

  - `Original.txt`: The original text (replace it with your own!)

- `src`

  - `construct.py`: Construct files, reading original passage, etc.

  - `main.py`: The main scripts, coding the agents' society.

  - `prompts.py`: Recording all the prompts and system messages for the agents.

- `.gitignore`

- `requirements.txt`

## Usage

### Installation

Install requirements via:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Then you can just run the files and enjoy the world of Agents!ðŸ˜Š

### Demo
